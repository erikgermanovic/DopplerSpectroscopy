# DopplerSpectroscopy
The program calculates the mass of an extrasolar planet by examining a varying Doppler shift in the emitted light of a star, given by two data files. It also calculates the magnitude and angular frequency of the star's velocity, as well as distance between the planet and the star. Results are illustrated by chi squared contour and star's velocity sinusoidal fit plots.
